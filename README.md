Live Airquality Check App:
"Live Airquality" is an online simple and free tool built using Django and AirNow API. Use this tool to scan air quality in your city using ZIP code. This tool uses API provided by AIR-NOW ( Government Organization in USA), hence only ZIP codes from USA would be valid. Currently for few ZIP codes you might see no results : it might be due to insufficient data gathered by API so please check back later or scan using other ZIP codes from USA.
