    <p>"Live Weather" is an online simple and free tool to check current weather of your city using zipcode and

    <h5>Live Airquality Check App:</h5>
    </br>

    <p> "Live Airquality" is an online simple and free tool built using Django and AirNow API. Use this tool to scan air quality in your city using
        ZIP code.
        This tool uses API provided by AIR-NOW ( Government Organization in USA), hence only ZIP codes from
        USA would be valid.
        Currently for few ZIP codes you might see no results : it might be due to insufficient data gathered
        by API so please check back later or scan using other ZIP codes from USA.
    </p>
    </br>




    <p>For easy reference I have included few ZIP Codes that you might want to use to scan the city air
        quality.
